# Cat VS Dog VS Perro
# Machine Learning JS From Scratch
This machine learning from scratch program in js allows to detect if it is an image of a cat or a dog or a parrot. It works by dicotomic search, since it first searches if it is a cat or other animals, and then recalculates to determine if it is a dog or a parrot.
